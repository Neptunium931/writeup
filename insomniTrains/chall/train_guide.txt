How do trains operate without crashing?

The tracks are controlled by humans so there must be some protection built-in for safety of the trains.
Since the train may de-rail if the switch is switched direct below it, train system implements a so called interlock.
Interlock permanently gets feedback from sensors on track if the segment of the switch is occupied or not. If the segment is occupied, it won't allow switching.
Segment occupation is overwatched by track sensors. If the segment entrance sensor is triggered then the traffic light turns RED meaning that segment is occupied and cannot be switched.
On the other hand, if the exit sensor is triggered then traffic light is GREEN and the segment is free, so the switch can be switched.

Examples:

^ : track sensor
* : traffic light
X : rail switch
▓ : train


Train entered the segment. Segment is occupied now. Traffic light is RED and X cannot switch to B.

           ▓▓▓▓▓▓▓->
Track A: -------^*-----X------^------
Track B:               \-----^---------

Train left the segment. Segment is free now. Traffic light is GREEN and X can switch to B.

                                 ▓▓▓▓▓▓▓->
Track A: -------^*-----X------^------
Track B:               \-----^---------

This is a so-called interlocking principle for securing the route for train journeys.
Only when controller receives and confirms those commands, the switch can be set to another track:

1. Checking the admissibility of setting a route. Is the switch already in requested position?
2. Setting the route according to the locking documents. The switch position is requested.
3. Checking the route for clearance.
4. Securing the route by setting and locking the switch.
